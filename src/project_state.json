  "architectural_notes": [
    "Separate offline training (Python/PyTorch) from low-latency execution service; execution receives intents and enforces risk rules server-side.",
    "Use Gym-style simulator/backtester that replays historical market/orderbook data and models slippage, latency, fees, and partial fills.",
    "Hybrid approach: forecasting model outputs (LSTM/GRU) become features for the RL execution policy (PPO/SAC).",
    "Risk-aware reward design: equity delta with drawdown/volatility/transaction-cost penalties and large liquidation penalty.",
    "Non-negotiable safety layer: kill-switch, daily loss cap, per-trade risk cap, leverage clamp, min-notional checks, order rate limits, and reconciliation checks.",
    "Deployment requires model versioning + canary rollout + rollback, plus monitoring for PnL, drawdown, drift, latency, and token usage if LLMs are used.",
    "Add an exchange integration layer (Binance connector) with secure API credential storage, permissions scoping, and environment separation (testnet/paper vs live).",
    "Support explicit execution modes (paper/shadow/live) with distinct routing, safety gates, and audit logging to prevent accidental live orders."
